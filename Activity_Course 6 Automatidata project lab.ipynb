If it happened often, drivers might not trust the app. Drivers are unlikely to pick up people who are predicted to not leave tips. Customers will have difficulty finding a taxi that will pick them up, and might get angry at the taxi company. Even when the model is correct, people who can't afford to tip will find it more difficult to get taxis, which limits the accessibility of taxi service to those who pay extra.\n",

    "- The model is almost twice as likely to predict a false positive than it is to predict a false negative. Therefore, type I errors are more common. This is less desirable, because it's better for a driver to be pleasantly surprised by a generous tip when they weren't expecting one than to be disappointed by a low tip when they were expecting a generous one. However, the overall performance of this model is satisfactory. "

    "### **Task 4. Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this step, use the results of the models above to formulate a conclusion. Consider the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Would you recommend using this model? Why or why not?**  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Yes, this is model performs acceptably. Its F1 score was 0.7318 and it had an overall accuracy of 0.7003. It correctly identified ~80% of the actual responders in the test set, which is better than a random guess. It may be worthwhile to test the model with a select group of taxi drivers to get feedback.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **What was your model doing? Can you explain how it was making predictions?**   \n",
    "\n",
    "- `VendorID`, `predicted_fare`, `mean_duration`, and `mean_distance` are the most important features, but we don't know how they influence tipping. This would require further exploration. It is interesting that `VendorID` is the most predictive feature. This seems to indicate that one of the two vendors tends to attract more generous customers. It may be worth performing statistical tests on the different vendors to examine this further.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Are there new features that you can engineer that might improve model performance?** \n",
    "\n",
    "- Try creating three new columns that indicate if the trip distance is short, medium, or far. We could also engineer a column that gives a ratio that represents (the amount of money from the fare amount to the nearest higher multiple of 5 / fare amount. The intuition for this feature is that people might be likely to simply round up their tip, so journeys with fares with values just under a multiple of 5 may have lower tip percentages than those with fare values just over a multiple of 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **What features would you want to have that would likely improve the performance of your model?**   \n",
    "- Sometimes data simply will not be predictive of the chosen target. This is common. Machine learning is a powerful tool, but it is not magic. If the data does not contain predictive signal, even the most complex algorithm will not be able to deliver consistent and accurate predictions. Do not be afraid to draw this conclusion. Even if you cannot use the model to make strong predictions, still consider any insights that you could report back to stakeholders."
